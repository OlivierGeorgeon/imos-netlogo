This package contains the NetLogo imos extension (Intrinsic Motivation
System). It allows you to implement an intrinsically motivated agent 
(http://e-ernest.blogspot.com/). The rational and the details of the 
algorithm are available in:

INSTRUCTIONS
============

Use imos:init n m to initialize or reinitialize the imos (clear
all interactions and all learned sequences).
n (integer) = the regularity sensibility threshold (a low value 
favors the fast adoption of possibly less satisfying sequences, 
a high value favors the slow adoption of possibly more satisfying 
sequences. Suggested value: 5)
m (integer) = the maximum sequence length (a low value makes learning
long sequences impossible, a high value makes possible the adoption of
unnecessarily long sequences. Suggested value in a 2D space: 4)

Use imos:interaction n m o to declare an elementary possibility of 
interaction between the agent and the environment.
n (string) = The label of the interaction's action in the environment.
m (string) = The label of the interaction's stimuli generated by the 
environment.
o (integer) = The intrinsic satisfaction of this interaction. 
Note: each tuple [n,m] defines a unique interaction. Subsequent 
calls to imos:interaction will not change the satisfaction of that 
interaction.

Use imos:step m o to get the action to enact next, provided the 
previously enacted interaction.
m (string) = The label of the previous interaction's stimuli generated 
by the environment
o (integer) = The intrinsic satisfaction of the previous interaction 
(only needed in case the previous interaction was not yet declared in 
imos). 
return (string): The label of the next action to execute in the 
environment.
